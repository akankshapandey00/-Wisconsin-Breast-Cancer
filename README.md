# Predicting-Breast-Cancer

In this analysis of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The dataset provides features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass cells. The goal is to classify the cells as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on the features.

Here are the details and attributes of the dataset:

Number of Instances: 569

Number of Features: 30 numerical features

Target Variable: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

The dataset includes the following features, which are computed from cell nuclei images:

radius_mean: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter.

texture_mean: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.

perimeter_mean: Mean size of the core tumor.

area_mean: Mean size of the area occupied by the tumor.

smoothness_mean: Mean smoothness of the tumor boundary.

compactness_mean: Mean of the perimeter^2 / area - 1.0.

concavity_mean: Mean severity of concave portions of the contour.

concave points_mean: Mean number of concave portions of the contour.

symmetry_mean: Mean symmetry of the cell nuclei.

fractal_dimension_mean: Mean "coastline approximation" - 1.
